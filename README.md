High-Level to Low-Level Architecture Generator

This project is a web-based tool that helps convert high-level business requirements into detailed low-level technical specifications. Using advanced language models, it takes a business requirement as input and generates a structured breakdown including system overview, key assumptions, major system modules, API design, database design, core workflow pseudocode, and non-functional requirements. The goal is to make software architecture planning faster, easier, and more professional, suitable for reports, presentations, or project documentation.

The app is built with Python and Streamlit, and it uses an LLM (OpenAI / OpenRouter API) to generate the architecture automatically. It is designed to be simple and practical, without unnecessary complexity, and all API keys are kept secure using Streamlit secrets.
